(Well-formed predicate)
Well-typed predicate
Settled predicate
Marked exp -> bare exp
Bare exp -> marked exp (from scratch marking)

Actions and update steps preserve well-typedness
Settled, well-typed -> agrees with from-scratch
Either settled or can step 
Termination :)

Now the original big theorem follows from action commutativity
Which I don't even know how I'd express honestly
So maybe I just leave it to the above.
